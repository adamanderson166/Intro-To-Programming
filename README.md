# Final Project Information

## Stem Quiz
Stem Quiz was built to help guide students, ages 11-18, on the right STEM career path. It consists of a list of Y or N questions, that the user answers and helps them determine which path and what careers might suit them.

## Example Run
<img src="Stem Quiz Example.png" />

## Code Example
This code is important because it runs through the questions provided, and assigns a value to each STEM topic.
```
if (answer.equalsIgnoreCase("y")) {
  if (questionClass[i].contains("0")) {
    scienceCount = scienceCount + 1;
  }
  if (questionClass[i].contains("1")) {
    techCount = techCount + 1;
  }
  if (questionClass[i].contains("2")) {
    engineeringCount = engineeringCount + 1;
  }
  if (questionClass[i].contains("3")) {
    mathCount = mathCount + 1;
  }
}
```
